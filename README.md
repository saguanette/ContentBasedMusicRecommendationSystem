# Content-Based Music Recommendation System
This project implements a content-based music recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system recommends 5 similar songs based on features such as genre, tempo, energy, danceability and other music-related attributes. It supports Euclidean and Cosine similarity for measuring song similarity and provides a simple Gradio interface for user interaction. The project aims to offer personalized music recommendations based on the characteristics of songs in the dataset.
